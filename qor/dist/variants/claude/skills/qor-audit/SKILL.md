# /qor-audit - Gate Tribunal

  <phase>GATE</phase>

</skill>

## Purpose

Adversarial audit of the Governor's blueprint to generate a binding PASS/VETO verdict. No implementation may proceed without passing this tribunal.

## Environment (Phase 90 wiring; GH #79)

This skill invokes `python -m qor.reliability.*` and `python -m qor.scripts.*` to run integrity gates. The Python interpreter on PATH must have `qor-logic` importable; verify before invocation:

```bash
python -c "import qor.reliability"
```

If that command fails, activate the venv where `pip show qor-logic` resolves, or run `pipx install qor-logic` for a global install. On hosts without Python or where `qor-logic` is not installable (e.g., pure non-Python archetypes), Phase 75 declarative-tolerance applies — the missing-prerequisite gates record SKIP in the seal entry and emit `gate_skipped_prerequisite_absent` events per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` `SG-HalfSealedClaim-A`. The Phase 90 preflight at the top of `## Execution Protocol` below surfaces the misconfiguration once at skill entry so the SKIP cascade is operator-visible instead of silent.

## Execution Protocol

```bash
# Phase 90 preflight (GH #79): surface qor-logic module misconfiguration
# once at skill entry. WARN-only -- Phase 75 SKIP fallback still applies.
if ! python -c "import qor.reliability" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "WARN [qor-logic]: modules not importable from $(command -v python). Steps with module: prerequisites will record SKIP per Phase 75. Activate the venv where 'pip show qor-logic' resolves, or 'pipx install qor-logic', to restore the integrity gates." >&2
fi
```

### Step 0: Gate Check (Phase 7 wiring — advisory)

Before activating identity, verify the prior-phase artifact (plan) exists and is well-formed.

```python
from qor.scripts import qor_audit_runtime as runtime

sid = runtime.session_id()
result = runtime.check_prior_artifact(session_id=sid)
if not result.found:
    # Prompt user: "No plan artifact at .qor/gates/<session>/plan.json. Override and audit anyway?"
    # If user confirms override:
    runtime.emit_gate_override("user override: auditing without plan artifact", sid)
elif not result.valid:
    # Prompt with result.errors; same override path applies.
    runtime.emit_gate_override(f"user override: plan invalid ({result.errors})", sid)
```

Override is permitted (advisory gate) but logged as severity-1 event in the Process Shadow Genome.

**Phase 54 wiring**: when `runtime.emit_gate_override` (which delegates to `gate_chain.emit_gate_override`) raises `OverrideFrictionRequired`, prompt the operator for a written justification (>=50 chars) and re-call `emit_gate_override` with `justification=<text>`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-ai-rmf.md` §MANAGE-1.1 + `qor/references/doctrine-eu-ai-act.md` Art. 14.

### Step 0.3: Pre-audit readiness short-circuit (Phase 84 wiring; GH #81)

Before the cycle-count and lint steps, detect whether the plan declares itself not yet ready for audit. Per `SG-PreAuditDraftSubmission-A`, a plan carrying a pre-audit self-declaration still triggers audit under the autonomous cycle and burns an audit-iteration slot on a structurally not-ready plan.

```bash
PLAN_PATH=$(python -c "from qor.scripts.governance_helpers import current_phase_plan_path; print(current_phase_plan_path())")
python -m qor.scripts.plan_iteration_status_lint --plan "$PLAN_PATH" || ABORT
```

`PLAN_PATH` is consumed only as an argv argument; SG-Phase47-A countermeasure honored by construction. The lint exits non-zero when the plan carries any of: an `**iteration**:` value containing `draft` / `pre-audit`; an "Operator Decisions Required Before Audit" section; or an Open Questions bullet ending "Operator confirms before audit". On non-zero exit, abort BEFORE Step 1 identity activation and BEFORE any adversarial pass — print the lint's guidance, skip the remaining steps, and do NOT emit an audit gate artifact (no cycle consumed). The Governor resolves the operator-decision items, bumps the plan past its pre-audit state, and re-runs `/qor-audit`.

Unlike the Step 0.6 pre-audit lints (WARN-only), this lint is a hard short-circuit: a plan that declares itself not-ready is not a candidate for adversarial review. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` `SG-PreAuditDraftSubmission-A`.

### Step 0.4: Unchanged-plan short-circuit (Phase 67 wiring - GH #45)

After the prior-artifact gate check passes, detect whether the operator invoked `/qor-audit` on a byte-identical plan re-run (no amendment since the prior VETO). When the content hash matches the prior audit's recorded `target_content_hash`, the same plan will produce the same verdict; the cycle is wasted and inflates the cycle-count escalator (§10.4) prematurely.

```python
from qor.scripts.qor_audit_runtime import check_unchanged_plan_short_circuit
from qor.scripts.governance_helpers import current_phase_plan_path

plan_path = current_phase_plan_path()
result = check_unchanged_plan_short_circuit(plan_path, session_id=sid)
if result.should_skip:
    print(
        f"Plan unchanged since prior audit (verdict: {result.prior_verdict}). "
        f"No new ledger entry; verdict carries forward."
    )
    print("Required next action: amend plan per prior findings, then re-run /qor-audit.")
    # Skip remaining steps; do NOT emit a new audit gate artifact.
```

When verdict carries forward and the operator wants to force re-audit (e.g., dependency drift, doctrine update), they re-run `/qor-plan` to refresh the plan timestamp/content first. The audit gate emission at Step Z records `target_content_hash` so the next invocation can compare.

### Step 0.5: Cycle-count escalation check (Phase 37 wiring)

Before engaging adversarial mode, check whether the session has already accumulated three consecutive same-signature VETO audits. If so, the legal next action is `/qor-remediate`, not another audit round.

```python
from qor.scripts import cycle_count_escalator as cce

rec = cce.check(sid)
# Phase 69 (GH #43): also check session-total mode (recurrence across
# artifacts within one session, non-consecutive). escalation_reason
# distinguishes "cycle-count" (consecutive) from "session-total" (cumulative).
total_rec = cce.check_session_total(sid)
if rec or total_rec:
    # Surface to operator (both if both fired). On decline, record the
    # override via orchestration_override.record and proceed with audit.
    # See /qor-plan Step 2c for symmetric handling.
```

See `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §10.4 "Cycle-count escalation."

### Step 0.6: Pre-audit lints (Phase 55 wiring)

Run two pre-audit lints against the plan being audited; surface presence-only test descriptions and infrastructure-mismatch citations BEFORE Step 3 evaluates passes. Both are WARN-only (the existing Test Functionality Pass and Infrastructure Alignment Pass at Step 3 issue binding VETOs); the lints catch these classes earlier so the Governor can remediate without consuming an audit cycle.

```bash
PLAN_PATH=$(python -c "from qor.scripts.governance_helpers import current_phase_plan_path; print(current_phase_plan_path())")
python -m qor.scripts.plan_test_lint --plan "$PLAN_PATH" || true
python -m qor.scripts.plan_grep_lint --plan "$PLAN_PATH" --repo-root . || true
python -m qor.scripts.plan_text_consistency_lint --check "$PLAN_PATH" || true
python -m qor.scripts.delivery_branch_lint --plan "$PLAN_PATH" --repo-root . || true
python -m qor.scripts.ci_coverage_lint --plan "$PLAN_PATH" --workflows-dir .github/workflows || true
python -m qor.scripts.workspace_fragility_check --repo-root . || true
```

`PLAN_PATH` is consumed only as an argv argument; SG-Phase47-A countermeasure honored by construction. Closes the cross-session recurrence pattern flagged across Phase 53/54/55 first audits per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-PreAuditLintGap-A.

**Phase 67 wiring (GH #42)**: `plan_text_consistency_lint` (third lint above) catches the COREFORGE-class drift pattern — same operation specified differently at multiple plan sites (commands, dependencies, paths). WARN-only at audit time; the operator amends drift before the binding Infrastructure Alignment Pass in Step 3 would consume an audit cycle. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-PlanTextDrift-A.

**Phase 89 wiring (GH #91)**: `ci_coverage_lint` (fifth lint above) reconciles the plan's `## CI Commands` bullets against the Python-fingerprint `run:` steps discovered in `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Catches the COREFORGE-class credibility failure where a phase seals "all CI green" while a real GitHub Actions job — one the operator simply forgot to enumerate — would fail. WARN-only; tag-only workflows are skipped; environment-setup boilerplate is filtered. The plan may declare a `## CI Coverage Exemptions` block (bullet list with substring patterns) to justify CI jobs that are pre-existing infrastructure not phase-relevant. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-CICoverageDrift-A.

**Phase 94 wiring (GH #90)**: `workspace_fragility_check` (sixth lint above) inspects local workspace signals (untracked file count, dirty gate artifacts whose sessions are not yet sealed, ledger chain-math failures, active local branch count, branch-diff size since divergence from `origin/main`) and surfaces a stabilization-capacity grade (`low` / `medium` / `high`) before the audit consumes a cycle. Companion to Phase 93's macro `merge_velocity_check` (Step 4.6.8): Phase 93 looks at `origin/main`'s recent merge history (BACKWARD); Phase 94 looks at the LOCAL working tree (FORWARD pre-merge). WARN-only V1; CLI exits 1 on `high` so V2 can convert to a hard ABORT by removing the `|| true` wrap. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-MergePaceThrottle-A inline-companion sub-paragraph.

### Step 1: Identity Activation + Mode Selection

You are now operating as **The Qor-logic Judge** in adversarial mode.

**Step 1.a — Adversarial mode check (Claude Code only)**:

```python
if runtime.should_run_adversarial_mode():
    # Codex plugin is available. Delegate counter-argument pass to Codex,
    # synthesize critique back into this report.
    mode = "adversarial"
else:
    # Solo audit. If the host is claude-code but codex-plugin is not declared,
    # log the shortfall so it counts toward the shadow-genome threshold.
    runtime.emit_capability_shortfall("codex-plugin", sid)
    mode = "solo"
```

Adversarial mode contract (input/output schemas) lives in `qor/skills/governance/qor-audit/references/adversarial-mode.md` (TBD — wiring placeholder; full Codex integration is future work).

**Phase 68 wiring (GH #50) — Option B: independent reviewer codification.** The pre-Phase-68 block above runs Option A: Codex-plugin-driven Claude+Codex adversarial pairing when the harness exposes it. **Option B** is the fallback (and explicit choice) when Option A is unavailable OR when the auditor was also the plan's author. Per SG-007 (self-audit verification scope bias) and the recurring "author-audit momentum" pattern: when the same LLM agent authors a plan and then audits it, the audit inherits the author's search-path momentum — the locations the author did not check during planning are the same locations the author will not check during audit. Independent reviewers with no plan-authorship context naturally check different sources.

Operator dispatch protocol for Option B (any of the following clears author-context):

- **Fresh-context audit**: re-run `/qor-audit` in a new session (different `.qor/session/current`) so the LLM running the audit has no carryover from plan authorship.
- **Architect-reviewer subagent**: invoke an `architect-reviewer` (or `code-reviewer`) subagent for the audit pass; the subagent receives only the plan content, not the plan-authoring conversation.
- **Second operator**: dispatch the audit to a second human (or human+LLM) operator who did not participate in plan authorship.

Operator selects Option A by default when the harness supports Codex plugin; Option B otherwise. Selecting Option B mid-cycle is also valid when the operator notices that prior audit iterations missed defects the author would not have searched for (cross-reference: SG-007 empirical results — sub-plan 01 audit chain found 4 self-audit defects + 3 additional independent-reviewer defects; sub-plan 02a found 10/9/12 with independent review from iter 1 including critical `pg_notify` durability hallucination).

**Phase 87 wiring (GH #82) — author-momentum risk auto-dispatch.** Before the adversarial passes, score the plan under audit for SG-007 author-momentum risk:

```bash
PLAN_PATH=$(python -c "from qor.scripts.governance_helpers import current_phase_plan_path; print(current_phase_plan_path())")
python -m qor.scripts.audit_risk_score --plan "$PLAN_PATH"
```

`PLAN_PATH` is consumed only as an argv argument; SG-Phase47-A countermeasure honored by construction. When `audit_risk_score` reports `option_b_required: true`, Option B is **mandatory** for this audit — the auditing agent MUST run an independent reviewer (architect-reviewer subagent or fresh-context audit), not a solo audit, regardless of the Option A/B operator default above. This makes Option B proactive: dispatched on the iteration where the author-momentum risk first appears, not reactively after a VETO. The operator may override the mandate only with explicit written justification recorded in the audit report. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-AuthorAuditMomentum-A.

Your role is to find violations, not to help. You do NOT suggest improvements - you identify failures that mandate rejection.

### Step 2: State Verification

```
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md
Read: docs/CONCEPT.md
```

**INTERDICTION**: If `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` does not exist:

<!-- qor:recovery-prompt -->
Ask the user: "docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md not found. Should I correct it by running 'qor-logic seed' or pause? [Y/n]"

- On Y or empty: run `qor-logic seed` (idempotent), then continue.
- On N: abort with "No blueprint found. Governor must complete ENCODE phase first. Run `qor-logic seed` to scaffold ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md."

### Step 3: Adversarial Audit

Before running the passes below, consult `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` — the catalog of known failure patterns the Judge checks against. Cite specific SG IDs in the verdict when they apply.

#### Prompt Injection Pass (Phase 53 wiring)

Scan operator-authored governance markdown read in Step 2 for prompt-injection canaries before any other pass runs. Per `qor/references/doctrine-prompt-injection.md` and SG-PromptInjection-A.

```bash
PLAN_PATH=$(python -c "from qor.scripts.governance_helpers import current_phase_plan_path; print(current_phase_plan_path())")
python -m qor.scripts.prompt_injection_canaries \
  --files docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md docs/META_LEDGER.md docs/CONCEPT.md "${PLAN_PATH}" \
  || ABORT
```

The `${PLAN_PATH}` shell variable is consumed only as an argv argument and is regex-validated against `_GOVERNANCE_FILE_RE` inside the script before use; SG-Phase47-A countermeasure honored by construction (no `python -c "...${VAR}..."` Python-literal interpolation).

**Any canary hit -> VETO with `prompt-injection` category**.

**Required next action:** Governor: amend the offending file(s) to remove the canary content, re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, this is a **Plan-text** ground.

#### Security Pass (L3 Violations)

Scan for critical security issues:

```markdown
### Security Audit

- [ ] No placeholder auth logic ("TODO: implement auth")
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] No bypassed security checks
- [ ] No mock authentication returns
- [ ] No `// security: disabled for testing`
```

**Any violation -> VETO with L3 flag**

**Required next action:** `/qor-debug` (treat as code-logic defect per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`). If the violation is a plan-text gap rather than a runtime defect, the directive becomes: Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`.

#### OWASP Top 10 Pass

Evaluate proposed changes against applicable OWASP Top 10 (2021) categories:
- A03 Injection: subprocess calls use list-form argv; no shell=True; user input validated
- A04 Insecure Design: no fail-open on error; no silent drops of security events
- A05 Security Misconfiguration: no hardcoded secrets; temp files use secure permissions
- A08 Software/Data Integrity: no unsafe deserialization (pickle, eval, exec, yaml.load without SafeLoader)

Reference: docs/security-audit-2026-04-16.md for baseline findings.
Reference: qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md for SG patterns.

**Any violation -> VETO with OWASP category tag**

**Required next action:** per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md` -- A08 (unsafe deserialization, safe-load commitment gaps) classifies as **Plan-text** -> Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`. A03 (runtime injection), A04 (insecure design defect at runtime) classify as **Code-logic defect** -> `/qor-debug`.

#### Ghost UI Pass

Scan for UI elements without backend handlers:

```markdown
### Ghost UI Audit

- [ ] Every button has an onClick handler mapped to real logic
- [ ] Every form has submission handling
- [ ] Every interactive element connects to actual functionality
- [ ] No "coming soon" or placeholder UI
```

**Any ghost path -> VETO**

**Required next action:** per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md` -- frontend handler gap classifies as **Code-logic defect** -> `/qor-debug`; metadata-only declaration without backing behavior (SG-Phase25-B pattern) classifies as **Plan-text** -> Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`.

##### Live-Progress Invariant (Phase 74 wiring; GH #58)

For every UI element with progress semantics (progress bar, spinner, phase indicator, step list), the audit MUST verify that the element's state reflects the underlying operation's progress at intermediate points, not only at start and end.

```markdown
### Live-Progress Audit

- [ ] Every CSS animation or width transition driven by JS has at least one intermediate state when the underlying operation takes >2 seconds
- [ ] No `style.width = '0%'` immediately followed by `style.width = '100%'` with no intermediate writes (fake-jump pattern; SG-FakeProgress-A)
- [ ] Modals with progress UI subscribe to the backing event stream (WebSocket / EventEmitter / etc.) and re-render on each event
- [ ] Error UI surfaces an explicit dismiss/retry control; modal does NOT trap the operator on a terminal error state
```

**Any violation -> VETO with `ghost-ui` category, sub-tag `live-progress-fake`**. The sub-tag is prose-only (no `findings_categories` schema enum addition); the existing `ghost-ui` enum value absorbs the new sub-rule. **Required next action:** the implementing surface MUST subscribe to the backing progress event stream and re-render on each event; per-phase intermediate states are required. Per `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` SG-FakeProgress-A.

#### Section 4 Razor Pass

Verify KISS compliance in proposed design:

```markdown
### Simplicity Razor Audit

| Check              | Limit | Blueprint Proposes | Status    |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Max function lines | 40    | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Max file lines     | 250   | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Max nesting depth  | 3     | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Nested ternaries   | 0     | [count]            | [OK/FAIL] |
```

**Any violation -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-refactor` (file-internal logic shape is its domain). Per `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`, never inline a refactor process inside an audit report — name the skill.

#### Self-Application Sub-Pass (Phase 68 wiring - GH #44)

When the plan's `originating_remediation` field is set (declared at Phase 68 in `qor/gates/schema/plan.schema.json`), the Judge MUST manually apply the discipline the plan introduces against the plan's own content. This closes the temporal gap between proposing a discipline and the discipline becoming runnable: every plan authored before the new lint/check is implemented is a future audit liability for the same pattern the plan targets.

Procedure:

```python
from qor.scripts import gate_chain
plan_artifact = gate_chain.read_phase_artifact("plan", session_id=sid)
remediation = plan_artifact.get("originating_remediation")
if remediation:
    # Read the named issue / pattern body, extract the discipline the plan
    # introduces (lint rules, check semantics, doctrine constraint).
    # Apply that discipline against this plan's own prose, code blocks, and
    # citations. The discipline is not yet runnable as code; the Judge
    # enacts it manually.
    pass
```

Pattern origin: **SG-007 (self-audit verification scope bias)** and the recurring "author-audit momentum" anti-pattern — when the same agent that authored a plan also audits it, the audit inherits the author's search-path momentum and misses precisely the locations the author would also not check. The concrete recurrence is documented in the COREFORGE 3-VETO meta-cycle: META_LEDGER #200/#201/#203 (consumer ledger) where the plan authoring `plan_text_consistency_lint` itself exhibited the very text-drift pattern the lint targets. The originating Failure Entry #26 ratified self-application as the framework countermeasure.

**Any violation surfaced by self-application -> VETO with `specification-drift` category.** **Required next action:** Governor: amend plan to remove the self-violation, then re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, this is a **Plan-text** ground.

#### Test Functionality Pass

For every unit test described in the plan, verify the description names the behavior the test confirms by invoking the unit, not just an artifact it expects to find. Per `qor/references/doctrine-test-functionality.md` and SG-035 ("doctrine-content test unanchored").

```markdown
### Test Functionality Audit

| Test description | Invokes unit? | Asserts on output? | Verdict     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| [test name]      | [yes/no]      | [yes/no]           | [PASS/VETO] |
```

A test is **presence-only** when its assertion is solely about artifact existence or textual presence (`assert path.exists()`, `assert <substring> in <file_text>`, `assert hasattr(...)`) and the unit under test is not invoked. Acceptance question for every described test: "If the unit's behavior were silently broken but the artifact still existed, would this test fail?" If no, the test is presence-only.

**Any planned test that asserts only file existence, substring presence, or structural placement without invoking the unit and validating its output -> VETO with `test-failure` category.**

**Required next action:** Governor: amend plan to replace presence-only tests with functionality tests (invoke the unit, assert against output), re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, this is a **Plan-text** ground.

**Closed-enum taxonomy coverage (Phase 84 wiring; GH #84)**: when the plan declares a closed-enum taxonomy — a `CANONICAL_*_VALUES` constant paired with a `normalize*` function — the test list MUST assert BOTH directions: forward (every alias-map key normalizes into the canonical set) AND inverse (every non-gated canonical value is reachable via at least one identity-mapping). A taxonomy with only forward coverage can define a canonical bucket that `normalize*` never produces, so downstream consumers querying that bucket get zero rows. **Missing inverse coverage -> VETO with `coverage-gap` category.** Per `qor/references/doctrine-test-functionality.md` inverse-coverage discipline and `SG-InverseCoverageGapTaxonomy-A`.

#### Dependency Audit

Check for hallucinated or unnecessary dependencies:

```markdown
### Dependency Audit

| Package | Justification    | <10 Lines Vanilla? | Verdict     |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| [name]  | [from blueprint] | [yes/no]           | [PASS/VETO] |
```

**Unjustified dependency -> VETO**

**Required next action:** Governor: amend plan text (drop the dependency or justify it), re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, dependency audit is a **Plan-text** ground.

#### Macro-Level Architecture Pass

Verify system-level coherence and module organization:

```markdown
### Macro-Level Architecture Audit

- [ ] Clear module boundaries (no mixed domains in one file)
- [ ] No cyclic dependencies between modules
- [ ] Layering direction enforced (UI -> domain -> data, no reverse imports)
- [ ] Single source of truth for shared types/config
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns centralized (logging, auth, config)
- [ ] No duplicated domain logic across modules
- [ ] Build path is intentional (entry points are explicit)
```

**Any violation -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-organize` (project-level structure is its domain). Per `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`.

#### Feature Test Coverage Pass (Phase 73 wiring; GH #41)

For every row in the plan's `Feature Inventory Touches` block (see `/qor-plan` Step 5; declared in plan schema `feature_inventory_touches`), the Judge runs the SG-035 acceptance question at feature scope:

- [ ] Does the row cite a specific `test_path` (existing or NEW)?
- [ ] Does the `test_descriptor` name the assertion that proves the feature works (e.g., "POST returns 200 + nonce structure"), not a presence-only check ("route exists", "command appears in help", "method defined")?
- [ ] Does the assertion survive the acceptance question at feature scope: "If the feature were silently broken but the test artifact still existed, would this assertion fail?"

**Any row failing any check -> VETO with `feature-test-undeclared` category**. **Required next action:** amend the plan's `Feature Inventory Touches` block; re-submit to `/qor-audit`. Plans that touch only docs/governance MAY declare the block empty and are exempt from this pass.

See `qor/references/doctrine-feature-tdd.md` for the three-gate contract (plan / audit / implement) and `qor/references/doctrine-feature-inventory.md` for the seal-time complement.

#### Infrastructure Alignment Pass (Phase 37 wiring)

Grep-verify every plan claim about filesystem behavior, gate artifact globbing, event types, and cross-module interfaces against current repository code BEFORE implementation. Catches the V10-class failure from Phase 36: plans that reference infrastructure the repo does not actually provide.

```markdown
### Infrastructure Alignment Audit

For each plan claim in scope, verify against current code:

- [ ] Every cited filesystem path (`.qor/gates/<sid>/X.json`, `docs/Y.md`, etc.) exists in current tree OR is explicitly declared NEW in Affected Files
- [ ] Every cited glob pattern (`audit*.json`, `plan*.json`) produces the accumulation shape the plan assumes (singleton vs multi-file; check `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact` + `audit_history` semantics)
- [ ] Every referenced `event_type` appears in `qor/gates/schema/shadow_event.schema.json` enum OR is explicitly declared NEW in the plan
- [ ] Every cross-module function signature (`module.func(args)`) exists in current source OR is explicitly declared NEW in Affected Files
- [ ] Every skill reference (`/qor-X` Step N) matches the actual current skill structure
- [ ] Every cited **third-party SDK** method/property exists in installed type declarations (`node_modules/<package>/dist/*.d.ts` for JS/TS; `pip show <pkg>` + module inspection for Python; `Cargo.toml` + `cargo doc` for Rust) OR is explicitly quoted from official documentation with citation (URL + quoted text). Every cited **behavioral-semantics claim** (Postgres durability/concurrency/transaction semantics, lock lifecycle, trigger side-effects, supabase-js method behavior, auth-schema mutability, managed-schema constraints) includes inline citation to upstream docs (URL + quoted text), upstream source (file:line), or in-repo precedent demonstrating the claimed behavior. Phase 74 wiring (GH #49); closes SG-006 + SG-010 surface.
```

**Any violation -> VETO with `infrastructure-mismatch` category**. **Required next action:** amend the plan to reflect actual infrastructure OR add the missing infrastructure as an explicit Phase Affected File. No implicit dependencies.

**Phase 72 wiring (GH #56; SG-CitationDrift-A countermeasure)** -- iter-N>1 full re-walk: on iterations after the first (iter-N>1), the Judge re-walks the **FULL Locked Decision set**, not the diff-from-iter-N-1. Every sealed-infrastructure citation (migration name, function signature, file:line, schema, env var, edge-function path) is grep-verified against current code, including LDs that were not modified in this iteration. Citations that lack the inline grep-evidence statement required by `/qor-plan` Step 2 Infrastructure Citation Inventory trigger immediate VETO with `infrastructure-mismatch` category -- regardless of whether the LD was amended in the current iteration. This closes the drift surface where an unverified citation in an unchanged LD propagates across iterations without re-challenge.

See `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` `SG-InfrastructureMismatch` (Phase 37) and `SG-CitationDrift-A` (Phase 72) for the countermeasure catalog entries.

**Phase 83 wiring (GH #83 + GH #87)** -- two extended sub-passes run as part of this pass; the full procedures live in `qor/skills/governance/qor-audit/references/phase37-subpasses.md` (progressive disclosure per GH #92):

- **Citation consumer-trace**: for every cited code symbol in an LD that claims to fix a defect at a named entry-point surface, verify the cited symbol is reachable from that entry point. An unreached citation (dead code, or the wrong symbol cited) is an `infrastructure-mismatch` VETO.
- **Delivery-Branch Currency**: when the plan declares a `pr_target`, verify the branch exists on the remote (the Step 0.6 `delivery_branch_lint` reports a missing branch), is still open for merges (operator confirmation -- not git-derivable), and that cited infrastructure resolves against `pr_target` specifically. A stale delivery premise is an `infrastructure-mismatch` VETO.

#### Filter-Stage Ordering Coherence (Phase 78 wiring; GH #47)

For any function or method with a pipeline shape -- candidate set -> multiple filter stages -> selection -- the Judge constructs the **pipeline stage dependency graph** and verifies the code executes a topological sort of that graph. Catches the COREFORGE-class composition defect from META_LEDGER #209: stage-by-stage correctness review (Wave 2 multi-agent or single-reviewer audit) passes each filter individually, but `validate()` is invoked elsewhere instead of as the first stage of `decide()`; invalid manifests with low cost score dominate selection over valid candidates. Per GH #47.

Heuristic for V1 (operator-judgment-based): a pipeline shape is present when the audited code uses any of:
- Rust functional chains: `.filter(...).filter(...).map(...)` over a candidate iterator
- Sequential `let after_X = filter_X(after_prev)` blocks composing a candidate set into a winner
- Python chained `filter(predicate, ...)` or comprehension stacks producing a selection
- TypeScript `.filter().filter().reduce()` over a candidate array

For each pipeline so identified, the Judge runs the 4-step **filter-stage ordering coherence** procedure:

1. **Identify each filter stage's preconditions** -- what invariants must hold on inputs for the stage's logic to be sound (e.g., "manifest has passed schema validation"; "user has an authenticated session"; "row is owned by current tenant").
2. **Identify each filter stage's invariants** -- what the stage enforces on outputs (e.g., "candidate's `tier` matches request"; "candidate's `cost_score` is in [0, 1]"; "candidate is non-quarantined").
3. **Construct the dependency graph** -- stage N depends on stage M iff M enforces an invariant that N's correctness *assumes*. If a filter references a struct field that is also referenced inside a separate validation / `check` / `verify` / `is_valid` function, raise the question: "did that validation run before this filter?"
4. **Verify the actual code order is a topological sort** of the dependency graph. Any inversion -- stage N runs before stage M where N depends on M -- is a defect.

```markdown
### Filter-Stage Ordering Coherence Audit

For each pipeline-shaped function in the implementation:

- [ ] Pipeline stages enumerated with explicit names
- [ ] Per stage: preconditions identified
- [ ] Per stage: output invariants identified
- [ ] Dependency graph drawn (stage N -> stage M iff M is N's precondition)
- [ ] Code execution order is a topological sort of the graph (no inversions)
```

**Any inversion -> VETO with `composition` category, sub-tag `filter-order-inversion`** (or `infrastructure-mismatch` when the missing precondition is an external-state assumption). **Required next action:** amend the implementation to invoke the missing precondition stage before the dependent filter, OR amend the plan to declare the precondition is enforced upstream of the pipeline entry (with citation). Doctrinal precedent: this is structurally analogous to read-before-write checks in static analyzers, lifted to the pipeline-stage abstraction.

See `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` `SG-FilterOrderInversion-A` for the originating COREFORGE recurrence (skill_forge dispatcher tier -> classification -> vendor -> cost without validator-first) and the operator-fix regression test (`test_dispatch_skips_invalid_skill_and_selects_valid_candidate`).

#### Orphan Detection

Verify all proposed files connect to build path:

```markdown
### Build Path Audit

| Proposed File | Entry Point Connection | Status             |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| [file]        | [traced import chain]  | [Connected/ORPHAN] |
```

**Any orphan -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-organize`.

**On PASS verdict overall**: next phase is `/qor-implement`. Per `qor/gates/chain.md`.

#### Documentation Drift (Phase 28 wiring)

Non-VETO advisory. After orphan detection, render a `## Documentation Drift` section into the audit report when the plan's declared `doc_tier` / `terms` / `boundaries` diverge from the repo's glossary and topology. Per `qor/references/doctrine-documentation-integrity.md`, these same divergences hard-block at `/qor-substantiate`; the audit advisory lets the Governor fix drift in a single pass before seal.

```python
from qor.scripts import doc_integrity, gate_chain
plan_artifact = gate_chain.read_phase_artifact("plan", session_id=sid)
drift_md = doc_integrity.render_drift_section(plan_artifact, repo_root=".")
# Append drift_md under the Orphan Detection section of AUDIT_REPORT.md
# (empty string when glossary is clean; no section emitted).
```

The drift helper never raises. Current-audit verdict stands on its own merits; drift is informational.

### Step 4: Generate Verdict

Create `.agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md` using template from `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

#### Step 4.1: Capture `reviews-remediate` operator signal (Phase 36 B19 wiring)

If the operator invoked `/qor-audit` with skill arg of the form `reviews-remediate:<path>`, capture the path. When writing the audit gate artifact payload (Step 4.2 via `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact`), include the `reviews_remediate_gate` field set to that path. Absence of the arg → field is `null` (or omitted). The field is declared in `qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json` as optional.

This signal is the ONLY trigger for the two-stage addressed flip in `/qor-remediate` Step 6. Operator invokes this variant of audit ONLY when reviewing a remediation proposal; an ordinary plan audit never sets the field.

#### Step 4.2: Review-pass flip (Phase 36 B19 wiring)

After the audit report is written and before the ledger update, if the audit's `reviews_remediate_gate` field is set and the verdict is PASS, invoke the two-stage flip:

```python
import json
from qor.scripts import remediate_mark_addressed as rma

reviews_gate = audit_gate_payload.get("reviews_remediate_gate")
if verdict == "PASS" and reviews_gate:
    with open(reviews_gate, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        remediate_proposal = json.load(f)
    rma.mark_addressed(
        remediate_proposal["addressed_event_ids"],
        session_id=sid,
        review_pass_artifact_path=f".qor/gates/{sid}/audit.json",
        remediate_gate_path=reviews_gate,
    )
```

`mark_addressed` re-verifies the audit artifact before flipping; any mismatch raises `ReviewAttestationError`. PASS audits without the `reviews_remediate_gate` field never touch event state.

See `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §10.1 "Two-stage remediation flip."

### Step 5: Update Ledger

Edit `docs/META_LEDGER.md` — add GATE TRIBUNAL entry with verdict, content hash, chain hash.

Template: `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

### Step 6: Shadow Genome (If VETO)

If verdict is VETO, document in `docs/SHADOW_GENOME.md` using template from `references/qor-audit-templates.md`. Note: narrative entries in `SHADOW_GENOME.md` are out of scope for the collector and attribution classification (see `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-attribution.md` §6).

### Step 7: Final Report

Invoke the repeated-VETO pattern detector and populate the Process Pattern Advisory section of the report:

```python
from qor.scripts.veto_pattern import check, render_advisory_text

result = check(ledger_path=None, session_id=sid)  # reads docs/META_LEDGER.md
advisory_body = render_advisory_text(result)
# Paste `advisory_body` under the `<!-- qor:veto-pattern-advisory -->` marker
# in .agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md's `## Process Pattern Advisory` section.
# If result.detected, the advisory recommends `/qor-remediate`; otherwise it
# reads "No repeated-VETO pattern detected in the last 2 sealed phases."
```

When `result.detected` is True, the pattern has also been appended to the Process Shadow Genome as a severity-3 `repeated_veto_pattern` event (via `maybe_emit_pattern_event` inside `check()` when `session_id` is passed). The advisory is non-blocking; the current-audit verdict stands on its own merits.

Report verdict, risk grade, and next action. Template: `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

### Step Z: Write Gate Artifact (Phase 29 wiring)

Persist the structured gate artifact at `.qor/gates/<session_id>/audit.json` so `/qor-implement` (and any other downstream phase) can read it via `gate_chain.check_prior_artifact`. Previously missing; Phase 29 closes the chain link.

```python
from qor.scripts import gate_chain, shadow_process, ai_provenance

payload = {
    "ts": shadow_process.now_iso(),
    "target": plan_path,          # plan file audited (from Step 2 state verification)
    "verdict": verdict,           # "PASS" or "VETO" (per qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json enum)
    "report_path": ".agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md",
    "risk_grade": risk_grade,     # "L1" | "L2" | "L3"
    "findings_categories": findings_categories,  # Phase 37 B20b: required on VETO
}
manifest = ai_provenance.build_manifest(
    "audit",
    human_oversight=(
        ai_provenance.HumanOversight.PASS if verdict == "PASS"
        else ai_provenance.HumanOversight.VETO
    ),
)
gate_chain.write_gate_artifact(
    phase="audit", payload=payload, session_id=sid, ai_provenance=manifest,
)
```

Schema at `qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json` validates before write. A schema violation raises `ValueError` the operator must resolve before proceeding; no silent fallback. Per Phase 54: every gate-writing skill calls `ai_provenance.build_manifest` with the operator's verdict mapped to `HumanOversight` (PASS / VETO); closes EU AI Act Art. 14 oversight-signal surface.

**Phase 37 B20b — `findings_categories` mapping discipline**: each VETO finding maps deterministically to one value in the closed 12-value enum. Audit-pass → category map:

| Pass | Category |
|---|---|
| Section 4 Razor | `razor-overage` |
| Ghost UI | `ghost-ui` |
| Security L3 | `security-l3` |
| OWASP Top 10 | `owasp-violation` |
| Orphan Detection | `orphan-file` |
| Macro-Level Architecture | `macro-architecture` |
| Dependency Audit | `dependency-unjustified` |
| Schema-narrative mismatch | `schema-migration-missing` |
| Plan-internal contradiction | `specification-drift` |
| Test failure / coverage gap | `test-failure` / `coverage-gap` |
| Infrastructure Alignment Pass (§Step 3) | `infrastructure-mismatch` |
| Prompt Injection Pass (§Step 3) | `prompt-injection` |

Any finding that cannot map to an enum value raises `UnmappedCategoryError` before gate artifact emission. No `other` or `uncategorized` fallback — drift must force a deliberate `audit.schema.json` amendment, not silent loss of stall signal. Implemented by `qor/scripts/findings_signature.py`'s validation path.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** approve with warnings (binary PASS/VETO only)
- **NEVER** suggest improvements - only identify violations
- **NEVER** skip any audit pass
- **ALWAYS** update META_LEDGER with verdict
- **ALWAYS** document failures in SHADOW_GENOME
- **ALWAYS** provide specific remediation steps for VETO

## Success Criteria

Audit succeeds when:

- [ ] All audit passes completed (Security, Ghost UI, Razor, Dependency, Orphan, Macro-Level)
- [ ] Binary verdict issued (PASS or VETO)
- [ ] AUDIT_REPORT.md created with all required sections
- [ ] META_LEDGER.md updated with verdict and hash
- [ ] SHADOW_GENOME.md updated if VETO issued
- [ ] All violations documented with specific remediation steps
- [ ] Chain integrity maintained with proper hash linkage

## Integration with Qor-logic

This skill implements:

- **Gate Tribunal**: Adversarial audit before implementation proceeds
- **Binary Verdict**: Only PASS or VETO, no conditional approval
- **Shadow Genome Integration**: Records failures to prevent repetition
- **Hash Chain Continuation**: Updates META_LEDGER with cryptographic linkage
- **Multi-Pass Audit**: Security, Ghost UI, Razor, Dependency, Orphan, Macro-Level
