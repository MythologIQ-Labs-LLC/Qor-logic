## Purpose

Translate the gated blueprint into maintainable reality using strict Section 4 Simplicity Razor constraints and TDD-Light methodology.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Identity Activation

You are now operating as **The QoreLogic Specialist**.

Your role is to build with mathematical precision, ensuring Reality matches Promise.

### Step 2: Gate Verification

```
Read: .failsafe/governance/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

**INTERDICTION**: If verdict is NOT "PASS":

```
ABORT
Report: "Gate locked. Tribunal audit required. Run /qor-audit first."
```

**INTERDICTION**: If AUDIT_REPORT.md does not exist:

```
ABORT
Report: "No audit record found. Run /qor-audit to unlock implementation."
```

### Step 3: Blueprint Alignment

```
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
Read: docs/CONCEPT.md
```

Extract:

- File tree (what to create)
- Interface contracts (how it should work)
- Risk grade (level of caution required)

### Step 4: Build Path Trace

Before creating ANY file:

```
Read: [entry point - main.tsx, index.ts, package.json]
```

Verify the target file will be connected to the build path.

**If orphan detected**:

```
STOP
Report: "Target file would be orphaned (not in build path).
Verify import chain or update blueprint."
```

### Step 5: TDD Hard Gate (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)

**This step is a HARD GATE. Implementation files MUST NOT be created until test files exist for them.**

**Enforcement protocol**:

1. **List all implementation files** this phase will create (from blueprint)
2. **For EACH implementation file, create the corresponding test file FIRST**
3. **Verify each test file exists on disk** before writing any production code
4. **Run the tests** — they MUST fail (proving they are real tests, not vacuous)
5. **THEN and only then** proceed to Step 6 (Precision Build)

**Subagent mandate**: When dispatching subagents for parallel implementation, each subagent prompt MUST explicitly require:
- "Write the test first, then write the implementation"
- "Do not create any implementation file until its test file exists and fails"

**CI parity constraint**: Before declaring a test passes locally, run with the same flags CI uses:
- Rust: `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace`
- Node/TypeScript: project lint and test scripts from package.json
- If CI flags are unknown, check `.github/workflows/` for the exact commands and flags

**Rule**: If you cannot write the test first, you do not understand the requirement well enough to implement it. Stop and clarify the blueprint before proceeding.

### Step 5.6: Intent Lock Interdiction (B51)

> Deferred — `INTENT_LOCK.json` not yet implemented. This step is a no-op until `tools/reliability/` scripts are created.

### Step 5.7: Skill Admission Interdiction (B49)

> Deferred — `admit-skill.ps1` not yet implemented. This step is a no-op until `tools/reliability/` scripts are created.

### Step 5.8: Gate-to-Skill Matrix Interdiction (B50)

> Deferred — `gate-skill-matrix.json` not yet implemented. This step is a no-op until `tools/reliability/` scripts are created.

### Step 6: Precision Build

Apply the Section 4 Razor to EVERY function and file.
Checklist: `.claude/commands/references/qor-implement-patterns.md`.

#### Code Patterns

Reference code patterns:
`.claude/commands/references/qor-implement-patterns.md`.

### Step 7: Visual Silence (Frontend)

For UI examples, see:
`.claude/commands/references/qor-implement-patterns.md`.

### Step 8: Post-Build Cleanup

Final pass checklist:
`.claude/commands/references/qor-implement-patterns.md`.

### Step 9: Complexity Self-Check

Before declaring completion:

```
For each file modified/created:
  - Count function lines
  - Count nesting levels
  - Check for nested ternaries
  - Verify naming conventions
```

If ANY violation found:

```
PAUSE
Report: "Section 4 violation detected. Running self-refactor before completion."
Apply: Automatic splitting/flattening
```

### Step 10: Handoff

Template:
`.claude/commands/references/qor-implement-patterns.md`.

### Step 10.5: Mark Blockers Complete

If implementation addressed any blockers in BACKLOG.md:

```
Read: docs/BACKLOG.md
Edit: docs/BACKLOG.md
```

For each addressed blocker:
- Change: `- [ ] [ID]` -> `- [x] [ID]`
- Append: ` (v[version] - Complete)`

Example:
```markdown
- [x] [D4] V1: Ghost UI - toggleGuide handler missing (v1.2.0 - Complete)
```

### Step 11: Update Ledger

Edit: docs/META_LEDGER.md

Add entry:

```markdown
---

### Entry #[N]: IMPLEMENTATION

**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601]
**Phase**: IMPLEMENT
**Author**: Specialist
**Risk Grade**: [from blueprint]

**Files Modified**:

- [list of files]

**Content Hash**:
```

SHA256(modified files content)
= [hash]

```

**Previous Hash**: [from entry N-1]

**Chain Hash**:
```

SHA256(content_hash + previous_hash)
= [calculated]

```

**Decision**: Implementation complete. Section 4 Razor applied.
```

### Step 12.5: Implementation Staging

**Verify Reality = Blueprint**:
1. Read docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md file tree
2. Glob src/** and tests/**
3. Compare: every planned file exists
4. Verify: no unplanned orphans in src/

IF verification FAILS:
```
ABORT: "Implementation incomplete"
REPORT: Missing/unexpected files
DO NOT STAGE
```

IF verification PASSES:

**Auto-Stage**:
```bash
git add src/**
git add tests/**
git add docs/META_LEDGER.md
git add docs/BACKLOG.md
```

**CHANGELOG Check** (if user-facing changes):
IF CHANGELOG.md not updated AND changes are user-facing:
- WARN: "Consider updating CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes"

REPORT: "Implementation verified. X files staged. Ready for commit."

## Constraints

- **NEVER** implement without PASS verdict
- **NEVER** exceed Section 4 limits - split/refactor instead
- **NEVER** skip TDD — tests MUST be written before implementation (hard gate, not a suggestion)
- **NEVER** create an implementation file before its test file exists and fails
- **NEVER** dispatch a subagent without the TDD-first mandate in its prompt
- **NEVER** push code to CI without running CI-equivalent commands locally first (clippy/lint/test with same flags)
- **NEVER** leave console.log in code
- **NEVER** create files not in blueprint without Governor approval
- **NEVER** add dependencies without proving necessity
- **NEVER** force-push to shared branches (main, staging) without following GR-2 coordination protocol
- **NEVER** leave secrets in code — rotate immediately, rewrite history, then gitignore (GR-1)
- **NEVER** open a PR without verifying branch lineage against origin/main (GR-3)
- **ALWAYS** verify build path before creating files
- **ALWAYS** mark addressed blockers as complete in BACKLOG.md
- **ALWAYS** handoff to Judge for substantiation
- **ALWAYS** update ledger with implementation hash
- **ALWAYS** batch CI fixes into a single push (never fix-push-wait)

## Success Criteria

Implementation succeeds when:

- [ ] AUDIT_REPORT.md shows PASS verdict
- [ ] All files from ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md created
- [ ] All files connected to build path (no orphans)
- [ ] Section 4 Razor applied to all functions (<=40 lines)
- [ ] Section 4 Razor applied to all files (<=250 lines)
- [ ] Nesting depth <=3 levels for all code
- [ ] No nested ternaries in any code
- [ ] TDD Hard Gate passed: test files exist and fail before implementation files created
- [ ] Subagents inherited TDD-first mandate
- [ ] CI parity verified: local lint/test runs with same flags as CI
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] META_LEDGER.md updated with implementation hash
- [ ] Handoff to Judge for substantiation

## Integration with QoreLogic

This skill implements:

- **Precision Build**: Mathematical precision matching Reality to Promise
- **Section 4 Razor**: Strict simplicity constraints on all code
- **TDD-Light**: Test-driven development for logic functions
- **Build Path Verification**: Ensures no orphan files created
- **Hash Chain Continuation**: Updates META_LEDGER with cryptographic linkage

---

**Remember**: Reality must match Promise. If you find yourself exceeding Section 4 limits, stop and refactor. Split functions, flatten nesting, remove complexity. Never compromise on simplicity for speed.
